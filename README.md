Hi,

I am a software engineer with 10+ years of in-depth experience in Backend, i.e. Applications Development and Systems Programming, who is able to demonstrate competitive programming skills in multiple programming languages, e.g. Java, Go, Python, C#, PHP, JavaScript, and I am always learning and improving other languages and skills as required.  I enjoy architecting and building highly concurrent, highly scalable systems.

I am coach, mentor and a leader who have lead small, medium  and enterprise scale, mission-critical, commercial and scalable products with varying sizes of the teams in multiple business domains. 

I am a strong advocate for clean code and best engineering practices. I try to create autonomous agile teams that can drive projects via evolutionary design and architectures and moving towards Cloud Native.

My philosophy is plain and simple, tech change, basics remain. So my focus is always to deepen the foundational knowledge and understanding, and then widen the variety of technologies to learn as I believe that there is no silver bullet and different tasks require different tools.

I am a detail oriented, open-minded, easy to approach friendly geek. Kindly, feel free to reach out or just [ask me anything](https://github.com/codeanit/ama).

Cheers,

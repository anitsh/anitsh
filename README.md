> Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. - IBM

### Not Finding Anything Useful?
This account started to get cluttered so am cleaning up this account.

I keep projects and open-source contributions separated. You can find relevant repositories listed in the organization:
- github.com/javacheatsheet
- https://github.com/csharpcheatsheet
- https://github.com/php-cheatsheet
- https://github.com/gocheatsheet
- https://github.com/typescriptcheatsheet
- https://github.com/reactcheatsheet

And many others.. I am working to make it easier to navigate soon in the future.

### Who I am? 

I am a software engineer with more than ten years of hands-on software design and development experience. 

*Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. - IBM*

I view Software Engineering as a discipline that teaches us how to balance the trade-offs that exist in every possible solution. An experienced software engineer is the one who understands the outcome of those trade-offs and takes the best course of action to solve the problem using appropriate tools and techniques where and when needed. A good read - No Silver Bullet —Essence and Accident in Software Engineering Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., 1986.

I try to keep up with tech-trend but I keep basics close to my heart.

### How to become good at software engineering?

***Be Passionate***
First and foremost, Software Engineering is my passion and that deep desire to be better at what I do drives me, what I am today, and where I want to be. So I believe one has to be passionate about the subject or in techology in general and how things work. 

***Pursue Basics, Tech Change Basics Remain***
I believe that deep knowledge and understanding of Computer Science and Mathematics are the foundations that every software engineer needs to grow deeper and strengthen as their career progresses, not the other way around. Data Structures are the tools, and Algorithms are the techniques that they must know and how to use appropriately to solve problems effectively and efficiently in the context of the Programming Language used, else we will be just hammering everything everywhere and literally making the Earth flat. Object-oriented Programming is not just about a programming language that has the “Class” keyword but it is rather a perspective to relate things with the real world where nothing is perfect, so we just try to find a good balance. 

***Review Artifacts, Don't Make [A Big Bowl Of Mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud)***
A perfect solution is a paradox in the programming world as well; There is always a give and take which we might have known yet; A sentiment from Grady Booch that I am fond of which helps me view the software systems. And there exist historical artifacts - Design Principles, Patterns and Architectures, if we know well, it will help to make appropriate decisions while designing system for the desirable quality needed (secure, scalable, extendible, robust, etc).  Furthermore, we should follow the best practices that will help make our system maintainable.

***Don't Be A Know It All, [The Mythical 10x Programmer](http://antirez.com/news/112)***
Success in this field to me is the respect we get from our colleagues and members of the community. I sincerely believe that, to be respected, first we have to learn how to respect others. The best attributes of the successful personalities I have known are their humble nature. They are kind and down to earth, making them easy to reach out to, and share more things openly. Secondly, we must always trust in ourselves, prove to ourselves, and become the hardest working person wherever we are. And last but not least, we must understand that growth is a natural process, we can’t force it so we need to take a deep breath, take our time, and neve give up on what we believe. A tree, as it gets bigger and taller as it grows, so does its roots and branches. And never forget where you have come from.

##### When in doubt, go closer, get direct experience, just do it!

I am cleaning up this account! I keep projects and open-source contributions separate.

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/dev-journey) used to be my learning management system before. Now I use [Github](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues). But both has their own values.

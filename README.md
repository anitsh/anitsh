### Who am I? 
I am a software engineer with more than ten years of hands-on-code software design and development experience.

*Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. - IBM*

I view Software Engineering as a discipline that teaches us how to balance the trade-offs that exist in every possible solution we are trying to find. An experienced software engineer is the one who understands the outcome of those trade-offs and takes the best course of action to solve the problem using appropriate tools and techniques where and when needed.


I try to keep up with tech-trend but I keep basics close to my heart.

### What are my beliefs?
First and foremost, Software Engineering is my passion and that deep desire to be better at what I do drives me, what I am today, and where I want to be. 

I believe that deep knowledge and understanding of Computer Science and Mathematics are the foundations which we, every software engineer, need to grow a deeper understanding and strengthen as our career progresses, not the other way around. Data Structures are the tools and Algorithms are the techniques that we must know and how to use appropriately to be able  solve problems effectively and efficiently and solve problems in the context of the Programming Languages we use, else we will be just hammering everything, everywhere and literally making the Earth flat. Therefore, Object-oriented Programming is not just about a programming language that has the “Class” keyword but it is rather it is a perspective where everything is alive, has relationships, dependencies, and has to die someday, like in the real world where nothing is perfect. 

A perfect solution is a paradox in the programming world as well; There is always a give and take which we might have known yet; A sentiment from Grady Booch that I am fond of which helps me view the software systems. And there exist historical artifacts - Design Principles, Patterns and Architectures, we must know well that will help us to make appropriate decisions while designing a quality system we need which might be secure, scalable, extendible, robust, etc.  Furthermore, we should follow the best practices that will help make our system maintainable.

Success in this field to me is the respect we get from our colleagues and members of the community. I believe sincerely that to be respected, first we have to learn how to respect others. The best attribute of a successful person I have seen is their humble nature. They kind and down to earth, making them easy to reach out to and share more openly. Secondly, we must always trust in ourselves, and become the hardest working person wherever we are. And last but not least, we must understand that growth is a natural process, we can’t force it so we need to take a deep breath, take our time, and neve give up on what we believe. A tree, as it gets bigger and taller as it grows, so does its roots and branches. And never forget where you have come from.


### Not finding anything useful?
This account started to get cluttered so I am cleaning up this account.
I keep projects and open-source contributions separated. You can find relevant repositories for [Java](https://github.com/javacheatsheet), [C#](https://github.com/csharpcheatsheet),[PHP](https://github.com/php-cheatsheet), [Golang](https://github.com/gocheatsheet), [TypeScript](https://github.com/typescriptcheatsheet), [React](https://github.com/reactcheatsheet)... There are many more which I will be listing out for easy understandging later.

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/dev-journey) used to be my learning management system before. Now, I use [Github](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues). Both have their own values.

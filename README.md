# Build Quality Software
Software development is an iterative process. Fast-feedback short-cycled iteration with self-review and retrospective to improve the quality of the team is the only way to add and improve the quality of the software becuase this is a team-sport as it requries a team talented individuals to design, develop and deliver valuable software with adequate functional qualities.

Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and learned as a precise science, by means of theorems and formulas. We can discover principles and techniques useful to be applied throughout the process of software creation, but we probably won’t ever be able to provide an exact path to follow from the real world need to code the module meant to serve that need. As the needs change, the systems has to adapt quickly, so we need to make the design flexible as the stiff design resists refactoring and the code that was not built with flexibility in mind will be hard to work.

The most basic general technique to design versatile system is by designing all the parts of the system, each and every component - **highly cohesive and low coupled**. 

**Design components that are self-contained,independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose. — The Pragmatic Programmer**

Good programmers are a little bit lazy. They sit back and wait for an insight rather than rushing forward with their first idea. That must, of course, be balanced with the initiative to code at the proper time. The real skill, though, is knowing the proper time. That **judgement comes only with the experience** of solving problems and reflecting on their solutions. — Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition

There is more **value created with overall alignment** than with local excellence. — Principle of alignment by Don Reinertsen

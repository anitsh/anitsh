# **10+ Years Of Professional Experience Designing, Developing and Delivering Value Added Software Products**

_Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and learned as a precise science, by means of theorems and formulas. We can discover principle and techniques useful to be applied throughout the process of software creation, but we probably won’t ever be able to provide an exact path to follow from the real world need to the code module meant to serve that need. Therefore, the  design  has  to  be  flexible. A stiff design resists refactoring. Code that was not built with flexibility in mind is hard to work with. Whenever a change is needed it will take a lot of time._

## High Cohesion, Low Coupling

_Good programmers are a little bit lazy. They sit back and wait for an insight rather than rushing forward with their first idea. That must, of course, be balanced with the initiative to code at the proper time. The real skill, though, is knowing the proper time. That judgement comes only with the experience of solving problems and reflecting on their solutions. — Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition_

_There is more value created with overall alignment than with local excellence. — Principle of alignment by Don Reinertsen_

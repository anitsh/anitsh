An advocate for clean code and best engineering practices, 10+ years experienced result oriented back-end developer, a competitive polyglot programmer with the history of delivering small, medium and enterprise scale, mission critical, commercial and scalable systems in multiple business domains through mentoring, coaching, leading varying sizes of the teams. I am interested in Linux and distributed systems. There is no one silver bullet to all the systems problems and different tasks require different tools, different perspectives, so, I am in a continuous learning journey. 

Amor fati.


### Code Is The Ultimate Truth 


Good programmers are a little bit lazy. 
They sit back and wait for an insight 
rather than rushing forward with their 
first idea. That must, of course, be 
balanced with the initiative to code at 
the proper time. The real skill, though, 
is knowing the proper time. That judgement 
comes only with the experience of solving 
problems and reflecting on their solutions.

Principle of Alignment: 
There is more value created with overall 
alignment than with local excellence.

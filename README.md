# Build Quality Software
Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and learned as a precise science, by means of theorems and formulas. We can discover principles and techniques useful to be applied throughout the process of software creation, but we probably won’t ever be able to provide an exact path to follow from the real world need to the code module meant to serve that need. So the design has to be flexible as the stiff design resists refactoring and code that was not built with flexibility in mind will be hard to work with because whenever a change is needed it will take a lot of time.

_The most basic general technique to design flexible system with **highly cohesive and low coupled** parts of the system. Therefore, design components that are self-contained,independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose. — The Pragmatic Programmer

_Good programmers are a little bit lazy. They sit back and wait for an insight rather than rushing forward with their first idea. That must, of course, be balanced with the initiative to code at the proper time. The real skill, though, is knowing the proper time. That **judgement comes only with the experience** of solving problems and reflecting on their solutions. — Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition_

_There is more **value created with overall alignment** than with local excellence. — Principle of alignment by Don Reinertsen_

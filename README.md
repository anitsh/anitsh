### NOW: I am connecting with people, preparing for interviews, looking for another great place to shine.


### About Me
I am a hands on code software engineer with more than 10 years of experience leading agile teams in various domains designing, developing and delivering value added systems. 

I am interested in Domain Driven Design, Distributed Systems, Linux, Containers, Automation, Security and Network. 

I relate "Title" with the role I have played in the organizations that I have worked with, and what I have achieved there, nothing more. Growth, and growth opportunity matters much more to me. 

The meaning of "Growth" to me is not about how many languages I know or frameworks I have used. It's about how deeply I have understood the fundamentals of Computer Science, how effectively I have used Data Structures, Algorithms, Design Principles, Patterns, and Architectures to solve problems at hand, and how well I have implemented best practices to reduce technical debts by learning, sharing and helping others become better at what they do.

Hence, I am not an expert. I am continuously learning, implementing it, sharing my knowledge and understanding, and looking forward to growth.  

I like to travel and make new friends and gain a different perspective on life.

An advocate for clean code and best engineering practices, 10+ years experienced result oriented back-end developer, a competitive polyglot programmer with the history of delivering small, medium and enterprise scale, mission critical, commercial and scalable systems in multiple business domains through mentoring, coaching, leading varying sizes of the teams.  

I believe that there is no silver bullet for all systems problems, different tasks requires different tools, so a change in perspective is needed for every instance in order to find a fitting solution and the only way I see it possible through continuous learning. There are so many things to learn but I am more interested in Linux and distributed systems.

### Code Is The Ultimate Truth 


Good programmers are a little bit lazy. 
They sit back and wait for an insight 
rather than rushing forward with their 
first idea. That must, of course, be 
balanced with the initiative to code at 
the proper time. The real skill, though, 
is knowing the proper time. That judgement 
comes only with the experience of solving 
problems and reflecting on their solutions.

Principle of Alignment: 
There is more value created with overall 
alignment than with local excellence.

### Who I Am? `More Than Ten Years Experienced Hands-on Code` **Software Engineer**

*Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. - IBM*


### What I Believe? `Tech Change Basics Remain`
I try to keep up with *Tech-Trend* but I keep **The Basics** close to my heart.
`Software Engineering` is a discipline which teaches how to balance **Trade-Offs**.
In order to make a balanced decisions, the view should be broadened because if you only have a hammer, you will only see nails.
The biggest challenge in this profession is to understand the techniques and use appropriate tools where and when needed.
And that is **growth** as a `Software Engineer`, not the years just spent hammering everything that came close.


### Understanding The Basics And Following The Best Practices Are My Remedy To Become A Sound Engineer
- If you do not have the foundation of `Computer Science` and `Basics Mathematics`, ** DON'T READ BELOW!**
- `Data Structures` are the **Tools**
- `Algorithms` are the **Techniques**
- `Programming Languages` provides  the **Context** where those tools and techniques can be used. Else you will be hammering no matter!
- `Object Oriented Programming` is not a just programming language that uses **Class** keyword. Everything lives and dies here, understand that. LIke us, they have relationships.
- `Perfect Solution Is A Paradox!` There is always a give and take; you may just not know it yet. Sincere sentiments from Grady Booch
- `Design Principles, Design Patterns and Architectures` are historical artifacts that helps to ease some pain solving the paradox
- Follow `Best Practices`
- Respect `Seniors`
- **Be Humble!**
- Growth is a natural process. Breath! Take your time! Look at a `Tree` 


### Not Finding Anything Useful?
This account started to get cluttered so am cleaning up this account.
I keep projects and open-source contributions separated. You can find relevant repositories listed in the organization:
- github.com/javacheatsheet
- https://github.com/csharpcheatsheet
- https://github.com/php-cheatsheet
- https://github.com/gocheatsheet
- https://github.com/typescriptcheatsheet
- https://github.com/reactcheatsheet

And many others.. I am working to make it easier to navigate soon in the future.

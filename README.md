# Code Is The Ultimate Truth 


Good programmers are a little bit lazy. 
They sit back and wait for an insight 
rather than rushing forward with their 
first idea. That must, of course, be 
balanced with the initiative to code at 
the proper time. The real skill, though, 
is knowing the proper time. That judgement 
comes only with the experience of solving 
problems and reflecting on their solutions.

Principle of Alignment: 
There is more value created with overall 
alignment than with local excellence.

## CODE IS THE ULTIMATE TRUTH 

**_Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and 
learned as a precise science, by means of theorems and formulas. 
We  can  discover  principles  and  techniques  useful  to  be  applied 
throughout  the  process  of  software  creation,  but  we  probably 
won’t  ever  be  able  to  provide  an  exact  path  to  follow  from  the 
real  world  need  to  the  code  module  meant  to  serve  that  need. 

**_Like  a picture or a building, a software product  will include the 
personal touch of those who designed and developed it, 
something  of  the  charisma  and  flair  (or  the  lack  of  it)  of  those 
who contributed to its inception and growth.

**_Therefore, the  design  has  to  be  flexible.  A  stiff  design  resists  refactoring. 
Code  that  was  not  built  with  flexibility  in  mind  is  code  hard  to 
work  with.  Whenever  a  change  is  needed,  you’ll  see  the  code 
fighting  you,  and  things  that  should  be  refactored  easily  take  a 
lot of time. _**

Good programmers are a little bit lazy. 
They sit back and wait for an insight 
rather than rushing forward with their 
first idea. That must, of course, be 
balanced with the initiative to code at 
the proper time. The real skill, though, 
is knowing the proper time. That judgement 
comes only with the experience of solving 
problems and reflecting on their solutions.

There is more value created with overall 
alignment than with local excellence.
